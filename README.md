As a short description, this project will be in close communication with the arduino side.
The communication between WebAPI and Arduino hardware will take place through a ESP8266 SERIAL PORT module. ESP8266 is a complete and standalone Wi-Fi network solution that can carry data software applications.
The measured data will include the level of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil
