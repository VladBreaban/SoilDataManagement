This project is the WebAPI and Angular part of my degree in ComputerScience.

As a short description, this project will be in close communication with the arduino side.
The communication between WebAPI and Arduino hardware will take place through a ESP8266 SERIAL PORT module. ESP8266 is a complete and standalone Wi-Fi network solution that can carry data software applications.
The measured data will include the level of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil

Once you have the data, the part of processing and interpreting them follows (we will also have an angular UI)

Updates coming soon
